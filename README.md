# LeanAideTools

This repository is intended to contain useful tools while minimizing dependencies to allow use with/without mathlib and also while developing (a branch of) mathlib. I hope to also have a branch/tag for each lean toolchain version.

At present, there is a single tool, for running tactics automatically in the background to try to complete proofs.
